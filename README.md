# Clojure for Beginners – Extracted Code Archive

This archive contains all code snippets extracted from the book **“Clojure for Beginners”**. Each chapter has its own folder, with code blocks saved in separate files and labeled by type.

## Folder Structure

* `Chapter_00_Front_Matter/`
* `Chapter_01_Untitled/`
* `Chapter_02_Untitled/`
* …
* `Chapter_12_Untitled/`

Inside each chapter folder, you’ll find:

* `snippet_001.clj`, `snippet_002.clj`, etc. — Clojure source code
* `snippet_XXX.edn` — EDN files, config, and dependency snippets
* `snippet_XXX.sh` — Terminal/command-line examples
* `snippet_XXX.txt` — Other code-like text that didn’t fit the above categories
* `README.md` — A quick count and legend for that chapter’s files

At the top level, there is a `MANIFEST.txt` file summarizing all extracted code.

## Extraction Method

* Styles, monospaced fonts, and syntax patterns were used to detect actual code, REPL sessions, shell commands, and EDN.
* Blocks were kept in order and grouped by chapter.
* Ambiguous content was kept as `.txt` to avoid discarding anything potentially useful.

## Quick Stats

According to the manifest:

* Chapter 1 has 10 Clojure blocks.
* Chapter 2 has 63 blocks (27 shell, 7 text, 19 clj, 10 edn).
* Chapter 3 has 74 blocks (45 clj, 7 edn, etc.).
* …
* Chapter 12 has 61 blocks.

In total, **over 800 code snippets** were preserved, spanning Clojure source code, EDN configs, and shell commands.

## How to Use

* Open the relevant chapter folder when following along in the book.
* Run `.clj` files directly in your REPL or editor.
* Copy `.edn` snippets into `deps.edn` or config files.
* Use `.sh` commands in your terminal to set up dependencies or run tools.
* Check `.txt` if you’re looking for examples that didn’t classify cleanly.
